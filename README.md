rahul-cv
========

This is my resume/cv template. I wasn't happy with the LaTeX templates out there
for resume/cv's, so I made my own. This class was inspired by Trey Hunner's
[`resume.cls`](https://github.com/treyhunner/resume), but I wasn't a big fan of
the syntax. The only relevant file in this repository is
`rahul-cv.cls`. Everything else is just my personal CV.

The output PDF can be seen on my site
[here](http://rahul.sh/files/rahulparhi_cv.pdf).

You should probably only use this if you are me since I won't bother documenting
it.
