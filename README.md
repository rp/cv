rahul-cv
========

This repository serves to host my CV/Resume LaTeX class as well as my personal
CV.

I wasn't happy with the LaTeX templates out there for resume/cv's, so I made my
own. This LaTeX class was inspired by Trey Hunner's
[`resume.cls`](https://github.com/treyhunner/resume), but I wasn't a big fan of
its syntax. If you are a real person, the only relevant file in this repository
is [`rahul-cv.cls`](/rahul-cv.cls).  Everything else is just my personal CV.

The output PDF can be seen on my site
[here](http://files.rahul.sh/rahulparhi_cv.pdf).

You should probably only use this if you are me since I won't bother documenting
it.
