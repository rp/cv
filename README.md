rahul-cv
========

This is my resume/cv template. I wasn't happy with the LaTeX templates out there
for resume/cv's, so I made my own. The only relevant file in this repository is
`rahul-cv.cls`. Everything else is just my personal CV.

You should probably only use this if you are me since I won't bother documenting
it.
