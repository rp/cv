This repository has some LaTeX `.sty` and `.cls` files I either wrote or found
online sometimes. In particular, I wrote
* `tex/latex/rahul/rahul.sty` for all the macros I use in nearly every document
* `tex/latex/rahul/cv.cls` for my resume/cv
* `tex/latex/course/csci1933.cls` for course documents while I was a TA for that
  course at UMN

and I found
* `tex/latex/kbordermatrix/kbordermatrix.sty` to put numbers on the border of
  matrices (specifically for discrete time Markov chain transition matrices)
