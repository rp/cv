  {Software Development Engineer Intern}
  {May 2017 -- August 2017}
  {Amazon.com, Inc.}
  {Seattle, Washington}
  {}
  {
    SDE intern in Amazon's Core Machine Learning team. Aided in the development
    of a scalable internal platform for scientists and engineers that
    streamlines the process of accessing and analyzing large data sources,
    statistical modeling, and machine learning.

\subsection{Selected Undergraduate Research}

  {Efficient Top-\boldmath$K$ Ranking from Noisy Pairwise Comparisons}
  {January 2017 -- Present}
  {University of Minnesota -- Department of Electrical \& Computer Engineering}
  {Minneapolis, Minnesota}
  {Advisor: \href{\soheil}{Soheil \textsc{Mohajer}}}
  {
    Designing an efficient top-$K$ rank aggregation algorithm that ranks items
    from noisy pairwise comparisons.  This work is supported by a UROP award.

  {MP3: A More Efficient Private Presence Protocol}
  {January 2016 -- Present}
  {University of Minnesota -- Department of Computer Science \& Engineering}
  {Minneapolis, Minnesota}
  {Advisor: \href{\hoppernj}{Nicholas \textsc{Hopper}}}
  {
    Developing and implementing an efficient \emph{privacy-preserving}
    cryptographic presence protocol. The notion of presence protocol is for one
    to advertise to their `buddies' if they are online. This is usually
    implemented such that the `central server' knows the entire social graph of
    the service. We propose MP3---the Minnesota Private Presence Protocol---an
    efficient presence protocol that leaks \textbf{no} information about the
    social graph and maintains forward/backward secrecy in the event of a
    compromise.  This work was previously supported by a UROP award, and is
    currently supported by a UGRA appointment. An arXiv preprint of this work is
    currently available.
